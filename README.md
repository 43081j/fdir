‚ö° **Extremely Fast:** Nothing beats `fdir` in speed. It can easily crawl a directory containing **1 million files in < 1 second.**

üí° **Stupidly Easy:** `fdir` only has 2 functions; `sync` and `async` for crawling the file system synchronously or asynchronously.

ü§ñ **Zero Dependencies:** `fdir` uses pure NodeJS `fs` & `path` namespaces. Nothing else is ever touched.

üï∫ **Astonishingly Small:** < 1KB in size

üî• **All Node Versions Supported:** `fdir` runs everywhere on all Node versions (within reason). And it is unsurprisingly fastest there too.

## Support

> Do you like this project? [Support me by donating](https://ko-fi.com/thecodrr), creating an issue, becoming a stargazer or opening a pull request. Thanks.

## üöÑ Quickstart

You can install using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm i --save fdir
```

or Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add fdir
```

It makes no difference to me.

```js
const fdir = require("fdir");

// get all files in a directory synchronously
const files = fdir.sync("path/to/dir");

// or asynchronously
fdir.async("path/to/dir").then(/*blah blah blah*/);
```

And that's it.

## üìä Benchmarks:

```sh
$ yarn benchmark
```

**Specs:**

- Intel i7 7th Generation (7700HQ)
- 16 GB of RAM
- 256 GB SSD
- OS: Manjaro Linux
- Directory Size: 7386 files

**Notes:**

- Some people asked that I benchmark `no-op` (without options) version of `fdir`. I did and found no performance difference. The results were identical. (I didn't include it here as it wasn't anything special.)
- Some other people were doubtful about the authenticity of these results due to _frequency scaling_, _process overload_, _disk warmup_ etc. So I have updated the benchmark with new results that should resolve all those doubts. Here's the process I followed:
  - Hard shutdown the laptop (a couple of times just to be sure) to clear disk, ram cache etc.
  - Login directly to a TTY (avoiding any unnecessary process from starting).
  - Run the benchmark
- Alright, I will say it as it is. I am not an expert at benchmarking so feel free to advise me as to the correct way of doing this.

### Node v13.11.0:

|                        Synchronous (7386 files)                         |                        Asynchronous (7386 files)                         |

### Node v8.3.0:

**Note: As latest version of `rrdir` doesn't support Node < 8, I had to use version 2.0.0. Everything else is fully updated.**

## üöí API:

`fdir` is very small so there's not much to the API.

### `fdir.sync(string, Options): String[]`

This is often the fastest way to get files. However, it will block the main "thread" so use it with caution with large directories.

### `fdir.async(string, Options): Promise<String[]>`

Not always the fastest but works without blocking the street, so that's a plus.

### `Options`

Ah, the options. Not many of them. At least not as many as I'd hoped for.

#### `includeDirs: boolean`

Whether to include directories in the array returned.

`default: false`

#### `excludeBasePath: boolean`

Whether to exclude the base path for each file.

`default: false`

#### `searchFn: Function`

Use this to filter out files.

**Example:**

```js
fdir.sync("node_modules", {
  searchFn: path => path.includes(".git")
});
```

`default: undefined`

#### `maxDepth: number`

The max number of levels `fdir` should crawl before stopping. **The lower the faster.**

`default: undefined (i.e. infinity)`

#### `isExcludedDir: Function`

Use this to exclude particular directories from being crawled.

**Example:**

```js
const isExcludedDir = path => path.includes(".bin");
fdir.sync("node_modules", { isExcludedDir });
```

`default: undefined`

#### `ignoreErrors: boolean`

Ignore errors while traversing the directory.

`default: false`

And that's it.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQs:

**1. I looked at the code and there's nothing special. How is it so damn fast then?**

Well, that's the whole point. `fdir` exists to prove to the "young" generation that you don't need to use special constructs or special methods to gain speed. Just a bit of patience and brains.

**2. I found X library. I ran its benchmarks. It is faster than `fdir`!**

Um. Well thank you for embarassing me (just joking). Do tell me the name of this library though. I will try to optimize `fdir` and reclaim the first spot :smile:

**3. You are doing X and Y wrong! Do Z and it will improve performance!**

Yes. And I should probably do A, B & C too. The point is, did you run benchmarks with these suggestions? If you did and saw significant improvements, thank you. Now go open a PR :laugh:

**4. Why create this? What's the point?**

I know you don't care. Fine. There's no point behind this. It's "just for fun". No, wait. Actually, I created this, first of all, for me. I needed fast directory access in another app of mine, so `fdir` came into being.

**5. Why are all the other libraries so slow?**

Because they did not spend enough time optimizing it. Most developers give readability and cool code more importance than actual performance and usability. I have seen a library claiming to be the fastest by inverting the benchmarks. Literally. Gave me quite the scare until I went and fixed the benchmark. It was actually one of the slowest. :O

**6. How long did it take you to create this?**

Ummm. Maybe 18 hours? Make it a day.
